# Contributing Guide

Contributions to open source projects are importand and I appreciate your time and effort in doing so. Before you dive into coding please read following sections.

This project has been created as mostly one off project. As a such it is possible I won't have a time to implement new features as requested. If you happend to find a bug you might be more successfull to fix it yourself rather than only reporting it. Do not hesitate to report issues though. There might be other people who might be able to fix it.

See [DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md) for more information about the development.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests: `npm run test`, linter: `npm run lint`, structure check: `npm run check:structure`. All of them should pass.
4. Submit a pull request
